abstract = {Taxonomic diversity refers to the number and the relative abundance of species in a community. Functional diversity refers to the different types of processes in a community that are important to its structure and dynamic stability. Taxonomic and functional diversity have been presented as being different and, as the title implies, competing approaches to the study of biodiversity. This article will provide specific examples of how taxonomic and functional diversity are interrelated and how information from both perspectives can be used to estimate biodiversity and propose mechanisms that govern biodiversity.}
